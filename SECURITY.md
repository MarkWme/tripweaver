# Security Measures for CVE-2025-6297 Mitigation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to mitigate CVE-2025-6297, a high-severity vulnerability in dpkg that affects directory permission sanitization during control member extraction.

## Vulnerability Details

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-6297  
- **Severity**: High (8.2)
- **Component**: debian:bookworm:dpkg 1.21.22
- **Impact**: Potential disk exhaustion attacks through temporary file accumulation

## Implemented Mitigations

### 1. Disk Space Monitoring

#### API Endpoints
The following monitoring endpoints have been added to the FastAPI application:

- `GET /healthz` - Enhanced health check including disk monitoring
- `GET /security/disk-status` - Detailed disk usage statistics  
- `GET /security/temp-dirs` - Temporary directory statistics
- `POST /security/cleanup` - Cleanup endpoint for temporary files (admin access required)

#### Example Health Check Response
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "disk_health": {
        "status": "healthy",
        "disk_usage": {
            "path": "/",
            "used_percent": 63.89,
            "free_percent": 36.08
        },
        "temp_directories": [
            {
                "path": "/tmp",
                "file_count": 49,
                "dpkg_related_files": 0
            }
        ],
        "alerts": [],
        "cve_mitigation": "CVE-2025-6297"
    }
}
```

### 2. Container Security Enhancements

#### Docker Configuration
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory constraints to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Secure tmpfs mounts**: Limited-size temporary filesystems to prevent disk exhaustion
- **Security options**: `no-new-privileges` to prevent privilege escalation
- **Custom temp directories**: Dedicated `/app/secure-temp` with restricted permissions

#### docker-compose.yml Enhancements
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '1.0'
      memory: 512M
tmpfs:
  - /app/secure-temp:size=100M,mode=0750
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
```

### 3. Automated Monitoring Script

#### cleanup-monitor.sh
A comprehensive monitoring script that:
- Checks disk usage against configurable thresholds (80% warning, 90% critical)
- Monitors temporary directories for unusual file accumulation
- Detects suspicious dpkg-related file patterns
- Provides automated cleanup capabilities (dry-run by default)

#### Usage Examples
```bash
# Run monitoring checks
./scripts/cleanup-monitor.sh

# Check help
./scripts/cleanup-monitor.sh help
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

#### Secure Temporary Directory Handling
- `TMPDIR=/app/secure-temp` - Override system temp directory
- `TEMP=/app/secure-temp` - Additional temp environment variable
- `TMP=/app/secure-temp` - Backup temp environment variable

## Monitoring Thresholds

### Disk Usage Alerts
- **Warning**: 80% disk usage
- **Critical**: 90% disk usage

### Suspicious Activity Detection
- **Alert**: More than 100 dpkg-related files in temporary directories
- **Monitor**: Any dpkg-related files older than 24 hours

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Monitoring
1. Check the `/healthz` endpoint for overall system health
2. Review disk usage trends via `/security/disk-status`
3. Monitor temporary directory accumulation via `/security/temp-dirs`

### Incident Response
If critical disk usage is detected:
1. Immediately check for suspicious dpkg files
2. Run the monitoring script: `./scripts/cleanup-monitor.sh`  
3. Consider manual cleanup of temporary files if safe to do so
4. Investigate potential attack vectors

### Automated Maintenance
The cleanup script can be run via cron for automated maintenance:
```bash
# Example crontab entry (runs every 6 hours)
0 */6 * * * /path/to/cleanup-monitor.sh
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Cleanup endpoints should be restricted to admin users in production
- Monitor access logs for unusual API access patterns
- Consider implementing rate limiting on monitoring endpoints

### Container Hardening
- tmpfs mounts are limited in size to prevent exhaustion
- Read-only filesystems where possible
- Security contexts prevent privilege escalation

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz

# Test security monitoring
curl http://localhost:8000/security/disk-status

# Test temp directory monitoring  
curl http://localhost:8000/security/temp-dirs
```

### Automated Tests
The existing test suite includes validation of the monitoring functionality through the standard health checks.

## Implementation Notes

This mitigation strategy focuses on **detection and prevention** rather than fixing the underlying dpkg vulnerability (which has no available patch). The approach provides:

1. **Early warning system** for disk exhaustion attacks
2. **Resource constraints** to limit attack impact  
3. **Automated cleanup** to prevent accumulation
4. **Comprehensive monitoring** for security operations

The implementation follows security best practices while maintaining application functionality and performance.
