# Empty namespace.conf file for security hardening
# This file prevents exploitation of CVE-2025-8941 by ensuring
# pam_namespace has no configuration to process
#
# In production containers, this file should be:
# - Owned by root:root
# - Mode 644 (read-only)
# - Located at /etc/security/namespace.conf
#
# No namespace configuration is provided to prevent
# symlink attacks and race conditions in pam_namespace
